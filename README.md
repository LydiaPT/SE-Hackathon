# SEHackathon -Data Science Challenge

### By: Lydia Petridi

This project was created for the purposes of "Schneider Electric Hackathon - Data Science Challenge" of 2022.

In this project I try to create a logistic regression model based on a provided dataset that contains data on industrial facilities and emissions across Europe, in order to be able to predict the pollutant variable.

The project starts with the union of the different sources of data, followed by some transformations and finaly the creation and appliance of the model.

The best f1-score obtained is 0.61 for the class 2 with the rest to be inferior, which shows that the model in its current form is poor.
